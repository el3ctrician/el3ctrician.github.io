I am a passionate Electronics Engineer with 7 years of experience in the market. My main area of experience is in Digital IC Design, but my experience touches on every aspect of electronics design from PCB design, firmware development, and IoT integration. My journey began shortly after high school where i interned technician in power plants, in line with my Diploma in Eletrical control and Automation. After obtaining my university degree in Electronics i moved toward designing Electronics Circuit on various levels.
Currently, Iâ€™m a freelancer electronics designer where I help my clients to develop cutting-edge technologies, transforming high-level concepts into precise implementations. As a dedicated Linux user for 14 years and an advocate for open-source initiatives, I thrive on community-driven innovation.
I also volunteer at Hacklab Cosenza, collaborating with fellow tech enthusiasts.
Guided by my favorite quote,

I am committed to using technology to enhance lives and inspire others every day.
