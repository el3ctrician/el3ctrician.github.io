# Optical Link Interface PCB Design

## Overview
This project involved designing a purely analog PCB to interface two optical links running the same digital protocol but operating at different wavelengths. The adapter converted signals between an 820 nm Avago HCS fiber link and a modern 1310 nm SFP link. By maintaining an analog approach, the design ensured the lowest possible latency while enabling seamless bidirectional communication.

## Key Features and Achievements
- **Analog Signal Conversion:**
  - Adapted **PECL** output from the Avago HCS fiber link to the **LVDS** input of the SFP module.
  - Designed a fully analog, bidirectional interface to minimize latency for both upstream and downstream data flow.
- **Schematic Design:**
  - Developed precise analog schematics using **Cadence OrCAD**.
  - Provided layout guidance for critical design elements, ensuring signal integrity and power efficiency.
- **Manufacturing Coordination:**
  - Collaborated with the PCB manufacturing facility to ensure proper delivery of all components and design specifications.
  - Verified manufacturing accuracy for controlled impedance and signal isolation.
- **Power Management:**
  - Integrated a low-noise, efficient power supply to support the optical modules and analog circuitry.
